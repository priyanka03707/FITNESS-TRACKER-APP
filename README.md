# DESCRIPTION
The Fitness Tracker App is a fully offline Android application designed to help users monitor their physical activity, step count, distance traveled, and calories burned using Android’s built-in sensors. The app functions without an internet connection, ensuring complete privacy while offering real-time tracking of movement. Developed using Android Studio with Java, the app utilizes Google’s Sensor API and Step Counter Sensor to track steps accurately and display the user’s fitness progress with interactive charts and graphs.
A key feature of this app is its ability to run efficiently in the background while consuming minimal battery. It uses Android’s accelerometer and pedometer sensors to count steps without requiring GPS, making it highly energy-efficient. The app also includes a daily step goal system, allowing users to set personal fitness targets and receive notifications when they achieve them. A beautiful and engaging UI with Material Design components, emojis, and animations enhances the user experience, making fitness tracking fun and interactive.
The MPAndroidChart library is integrated to provide visually appealing step history charts, allowing users to analyze their activity trends over time. The app includes a navigation system with 3-4 pages, such as Home, History, Goals, and Settings, ensuring smooth app interaction. Users can check their daily, weekly, and monthly progress through an intuitive interface, and the data is stored persistently using SharedPreferences or Room Database, ensuring fitness records are maintained even after the app is closed.
With real-time updates, users can see their step count increase instantly, keeping them motivated throughout the day. The app also supports dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions. Smooth animations are implemented to enhance navigation and make the app more engaging.
